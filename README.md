I think I made it add rows to the other player for every tetris the first player does similar to Tetris 99. Although, I faced some issues testing it.

# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

Apologies for the mess. YMMV.
